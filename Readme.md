# Job Application Task - React Junior 
- Name: Vanja Å ukurma,
- Position: React Junior
## Built with
1. React v17 + Vite,
2. AG Grid library,
3. TypeScript,
4. Axios,
5. Moment.js
## Start application
In terminal type:
1. `npm run build`,
2. `npm run preview`
## Approach & Methodology
A lot of task steps could be done by reading the AG Grid documentation alone and watching few videos provided by createors of AG Grid. Few things i did that weren't in docs are moment.js library for extracting timestamps and formatting it to dd/mmm/yyyy format. Also used Axios for fetching data from server.
## Time spent
Approximately 9-10 hours of active work. Bare in mind that I haven't used AG Grid before so it took a lot of time learning, reading and watching videos about it.
